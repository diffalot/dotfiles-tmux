set -g default-terminal 'screen-256color'

# despite all the blog posts and miscellaneous info I gleaned from the detrius
# of other people's computing configurations, I just don't know what to believe
# anymore.
#
# I don't know why it works this way. Everyone who said it shouldn't work this
# way acknowledged that it did. And they took action in their disbelief and
# compiled terminfo files, reverse engineering technology that has never
# existed, and we now have the closest thing to proof of the non existence of
# these strange devices: Not one of those blog posts was ever right in the end.
# 
# All you have to do to get that weird little terminal app on your phone to
# connect to these strange containerized, networked boxes in full truecolor
# glory, is set everything to pretend to operate at 256 colors and claim to be
# a progream called screen. It's true, here's what I did once I had exhausted
# all other possibilities:
#
#     1. I set the terminal was typing into to `xterm-256color`
#
#     2. One I was on the server it claimed i was merely `xterm` so i set the
#        TERM environment variable to `xterm-256color` and my way to join the
#        tmux session.
#
#     3. Once inside the session I bumped myself up frome `screen` to
#        `screen-256color` to match what tmux hat been configured it was:
#        `screen-256color` and everything has been smooth since then.
#
#        (I guess i messed up the first part of this story... just set
#        everything to it's nearest relative 256color terminfo because they all
#        try to emulate each other so doggegly that they somehow succeed. 
#
# And i dont think any of the hacks below here actually work. YMMV
